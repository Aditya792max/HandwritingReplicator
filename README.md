## Project Overview

HandwritingReplicator is a Python application designed to replicate a user’s handwriting style via image processing and automation. It uses captured character‐images to train/perform replication of handwriting and output a stylised handwritten version of digital text.

## Features

* Load a dataset of handwritten characters (e.g., from your own writing).
* Scale and preprocess images for uniformity.
* Read input text and generate an output in the same handwriting style.
* Test and experiment with different texts for replication.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Standard Python libraries (e.g., `os`, `cv2`/`PIL`, `numpy`)
* Any other dependencies you’ve used (please list them if specific libraries are required)

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya792max/HandwritingReplicator.git  
   cd HandwritingReplicator  
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate     # on Linux/macOS  
   venv\Scripts\activate        # on Windows  
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```

   *(If you don’t yet have a `requirements.txt`, you may add one listing libraries like `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `Pillow`, etc.)*
4. Ensure your character dataset is placed inside `CharactersDataSet/` (or whichever folder you’ve used).

## Usage

1. Populate the character dataset folder with handwritten character images, each labelled appropriately.
2. Run the pre‐processing/scaling script (for example):

   ```bash
   python imageScaler.py  
   ```
3. Run the main script to generate handwriting-replicated text:

   ```bash
   python main.py  
   ```

   You may also have test scripts for experimentation:

   ```bash
   python testRun.py  
   ```
4. Enter the input text when prompted (or modify `main.py` to read from a file) and see the output image (e.g., `output_text.png`).

## Project Structure

```
HandwritingReplicator/
├── CharactersDataSet/      # Directory for handwritten character images  
├── fileReading.py          # Reads input text or dataset metadata  
├── imageScaler.py          # Scales and preprocesses character images  
├── main.py                 # Primary application script  
├── testRun.py              # Testing / experiment script  
├── file1.py                # [Add description if meaningful]  
├── README.txt              # Alternate README file  
└── output_text.png         # Example output image  
```

*(Rename or adjust filenames/descriptions according to their actual role in your repo.)*

## How It Works

* The dataset of handwritten characters is captured (one image per character).
* The `imageScaler.py` ensures that all character images are aligned, scaled, and ready for reuse.
* `main.py` reads the input text (via `fileReading.py` or directly) and maps each character to the corresponding pre‐processed image.
* The final output is generated by composing the character‐images in sequence, resulting in an image (or PDF) that visually replicates handwriting style.
* `testRun.py` allows you to experiment with different texts or styles.
